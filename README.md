Creating RESTful APIs and deploying to Google Cloud Platform Using [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) for communication between Machine Learning Recommendation System Model and Mobile Development. Creating database in [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql)

---

# RESTful API 
In making the RESTful APIs we use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com), [CORS](https://enable-cors.org/index.html), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) 

# List APIs
